# HOW TO USE

https://placeholder-image-production.up.railway.app/200x200?text=simple-text

`200x200` - the resolution of image

max 2000x2000

`?text=your-text` - after `=` you can write own text(separated by `-` example: `?text=your-dummy-text`) which will display on image

when you wanna get blank image without any text you can pass this: `?text=notext`
